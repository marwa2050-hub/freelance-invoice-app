I built a Freelance Invoice & Client Manager app that lets me add, edit, and remove clients, create invoices, mark them as paid, and view summary stats on a dashboard. I learned how to use localStorage to persist data, modularize JavaScript with import/export, and manipulate the DOM for dynamic lists. The hardest part was keeping the UI state consistent while editing records; the most enjoyable part was implementing the invoice calculations and the random quote feature.
