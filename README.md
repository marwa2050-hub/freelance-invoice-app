✍️ Reflection

Creating the Freelance Invoice & Client Manager App helped me improve my JavaScript skills, including **DOM manipulation**, **array methods**, and **localStorage**. The biggest challenge was linking clients with invoices and updating the dashboard dynamically. I enjoyed designing a clean, user-friendly interface and implementing a motivational quote feature. Overall, building a functional, real-world app was very rewarding.
